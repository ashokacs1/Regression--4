        "Sure, here’s a brief overview of each question related to Lasso Regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
        "- **Definition:** Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression is a type of linear regression that includes L1 regularization. It adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",
        "- **Difference:** Unlike standard linear regression, which only minimizes the residual sum of squares, Lasso also adds a penalty to the size of the coefficients, which can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero. This helps with feature selection and reduces model complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
        "- **Advantage:** Lasso Regression performs both variable selection and regularization. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively excluding those features from the model, which simplifies the model and helps in feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
        "- **Interpretation:** Coefficients in a Lasso Regression model indicate the relationship between each feature and the target variable. A coefficient of zero means that the feature is excluded from the model, while non-zero coefficients indicate the importance and effect of each feature on the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
        "- **Tuning Parameter:** The primary tuning parameter is the regularization parameter (λ or alpha).\n",
        "- **Effect:** A higher value of λ increases the penalty on the coefficients, leading to more coefficients being shrunk to zero. A lower value of λ reduces the penalty, which can lead to a model closer to ordinary least squares regression with fewer coefficients set to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
        "- **Yes:** Lasso Regression can be extended to non-linear problems using feature engineering or transformations. By creating non-linear features (e.g., polynomial features) and applying Lasso Regression to these features, you can model non-linear relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
        "- **Ridge Regression:** Uses L2 regularization, which adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. It tends to shrink coefficients but rarely sets them to zero.\n",
        "- **Lasso Regression:** Uses L1 regularization, which adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coefficients. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
        "- **Yes:** Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity by reducing the number of features through regularization. It tends to select one feature from a group of highly correlated features and shrink others to zero, helping to manage multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
        "- **Choosing λ:** Use techniques like cross-validation to find the optimal value. This involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, fitting the model with different λ values, and selecting the one that provides the best performance on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
